# Mixer-and-non-ideal-coils
Code to evaluate properties of mixing fluxes and non-ideal coils with specified flux or room sensible and latent loads.
In the main code the user has three possibilities: 
1 solve to find thermodynmic properties of fluxes after mixing;
2 solve the non-ideal coil having specified the flux
3 solve the non-ideal coil having specified the sensible and latent load of the desired room.
