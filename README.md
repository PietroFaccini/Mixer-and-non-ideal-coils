# Mixer-and-non-ideal-coils
Code to evaluate properties of mixing fluxes and non-ideal coils with specified flux or room sensible and latent loads.
In the main code the user has three possibilities: 
1 solve to find thermodynmic properties of fluxes after mixing;
2 solve the non-ideal coil having specified the flux
3 solve the non-ideal coil having specified the sensible and latent load of the desired room.

In the repository can be found:
1 the main code (Project 2)
2 the additional code to plot the graph comparing results obtained with different recirculation rate√π
3 the folder containing the input files, as csv
4 the folder containing the output files (results)
5 Modules required to run the main code.
